Advanced Business Intelligence & Dashboards

ðŸ”¹ Topics & Explanations

1)Storytelling with Data in Power BI
==================================
Beyond charts, dashboards should tell a story. Use annotations, smart visuals, and layout design to guide decision-makers.

Example: A sales dashboard that not only shows KPIs but also highlights regional growth trends with callout cards.


2)Dynamic Filters & Drill-Through in Power BI
==========================================
Drill-through lets users click on a visual and dive deeper into specific details.

Example: From a product sales overview, drill into individual product performance per city.


3)AI Visuals in Power BI
======================
Power BI now has AI-powered visuals like Key Influencers and Decomposition Trees.

Example: Identify what factors (e.g., discount % or region) most influence revenue changes.


4)Data Blending in Tableau
=========================
Combine data from multiple sources (Excel, SQL, APIs) to enrich insights.

Example: Blend CRM data with web traffic data to analyze how marketing drives sales conversions.


5)Advanced DAX for Time Intelligence
==================================
Learn DAX functions like SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(), TOTALYTD(), PARALLELPERIOD() to calculate rolling averages and YoY growth.

Example: Compare 2024 Q1 sales vs. 2023 Q1 automatically in dashboards.


6)Dashboard Performance Optimization
====================================
Avoid overloading dashboards with visuals. Use aggregated tables, query reduction techniques, and incremental refresh.

Example: Optimize a dashboard with 1M+ records by enabling DirectQuery instead of Import mode.


7)Dashboard Design Best Practices
================================
Focus on clarity, minimalism, and business impact. Use consistent color schemes and align KPIs at the top.

Example: Executive dashboards with just 5 key tiles (Revenue, Expenses, Profit, Customers, Growth).
